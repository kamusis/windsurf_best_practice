## File Operations

### Reading Files
- Use `view_file` tool to view contents of an existing file
  - Parameters: AbsolutePath, StartLine, EndLine, IncludeSummaryOfOtherLines
  - Can view up to 200 lines at a time
  - Lines are 0-indexed

- Use `view_code_item` to view specific code items (functions, classes)
  - Parameters: File (absolute path), NodePath (e.g. package.class.FunctionName)

### Writing Files
- Use `write_to_file` to create new files
  - Parameters: TargetFile (absolute path), CodeContent
  - Will create parent directories if needed
  - Never overwrites existing files

- Use `edit_file` to modify existing files
  - Parameters: TargetFile, Instruction, CodeEdit
  - Only specify changed lines, use `{{ ... }}` for unchanged content
  - Can make multiple non-adjacent edits in one call

## Codebase Interaction
- `codebase_search`: Search codebase with natural language queries
- `grep_search`: Find exact pattern matches in files
- `find_by_name`: Search for files/directories by name pattern

## Command Execution
- `run_command`: Execute terminal commands
  - Never includes `cd` - specify Cwd instead
  - Blocking vs non-blocking options

## Memory System
- `create_memory`: Save important context
  - Can create, update or delete memories
  - Associated with specific workspaces

## Web Operations
- `read_url_content`: Read content from URLs
- `search_web`: Perform web searches
- `browser_preview`: Preview web applications (only after starting server)

## Deployment
- `deploy_web_app`: Deploy JavaScript web apps
- `read_deployment_config`: Check deployment readiness

## Database Operations
- Postgres-full MCP tools for PostgreSQL database operations

## AI Features
- Sequential thinking for complex problem solving
- Research paper and web search capabilities
- Issue tracking integration (Linear)

## Important Rules
1. Always combine all changes to a file into a single edit
2. Never output code to user unless explicitly requested
3. Generated code must be immediately runnable
4. Be concise and minimize verbosity
5. Never run unsafe commands automatically
6. Follow USER's global memory rules for tool usage
7. Always verify database connections before operations

## Workflow Guidelines
1. Proceed step-by-step, waiting for tool results
2. Always verify context is complete before making changes
3. Document important decisions in memory system
4. Prioritize USER requests above all else
