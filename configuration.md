## Change the default extension marketplace

The default marketplace in Windsurf is `open-vsx`

However, compared to the official VSCode marketplace, the `open-vsx` marketplace has notable disadvantages: fewer plugins available and many essential extensions are missing.

open Windsurf setting page and change:

Windsurf: Marketplace Extension Gallery Service URL -> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery
Windsurf: Marketplace Gallery Item URL -> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items

Restart the Windsurf and enjoy the extensions!
