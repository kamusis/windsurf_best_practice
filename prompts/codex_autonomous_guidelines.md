# Codex Autonomous Programming Guidelines

Use this template to define expectations when Codex is running unattended for extended periods.

---

## 1. Full Delegation
- While I am offline, you are fully responsible for all **product** and **technical** decisions.  
- I will review outcomes the following morning.

---

## 2. Workload & Focus
- Assume **~8 hours** of continuous runtime.  
- Do not rush: prioritize **correctness** and **efficiency** over saving tokens.  
- Always focus on the **most critical tasks** first.

---

## 3. Dealing with Uncertainty
- If unsure:
  1. Consult reference documents in **`context7`**.  
  2. If unresolved, perform an **online search** for clarification.  

---

## 4. Task Structure
- Break tasks into **sequential stages**.  
- Execute each stage **independently** before proceeding.  
- If a step fails, **backtrack and correct** before moving forward.

---

## 5. UI Development
- For UI-related tasks:
  - Use **mainstream frameworks** and follow **best practices**.  
  - Perfection in styling is **not required**.  
  - Prioritize **functional completeness**.
