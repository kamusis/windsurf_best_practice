# Workflow

## Plan at first
Describe the task objectives in Cascade panel.

Prompt:
```
I have an existing codebase that requires modifications. My planned tasks are:
1. Make alterations to `filename1`
2. Implement updates in `filename2`
3. Perform a review of `filename3`

Please provide guidance on how to PLAN these tasks without proceeding to implementation.
In your PLAN, include the specific commands I should execute for each step.
If you need any clarification, please ask before proceeding.
```

Review the task plan, make sure everything is clear and reasonable.


## Write paln

Prompt:
```
create a `todolist.md` file, use check boxes and list all the tasks you need to complete. make each task a tick box, put bullet points below it. 
```

## Implement plan

Prompt:
```
We need to follow `todolist.md` one by one because there are multiple things we need to accomplish and we should do them one at a time and test them before moving on to the next part.

once completed, you can work down the task list one by one ticking them off.

It's critical that all of the changes we make are done in a surgical way, with minimal code changes when possible. We must be very careful not to break or remove existing functionality. Do not introduce any new bugs or syntax errors.
