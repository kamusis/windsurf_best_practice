# Code Generation Guidelines

## 1. Language and Naming
- All code-related content must be in English, including:
  - Code comments
  - Function and variable names
  - Documentation strings
  - Configuration files
  - Error messages
  - Log messages
- Follow language-specific naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## 2. Code Documentation and Comments
- Add clear and concise comments to explain complex logic
- Include docstrings for functions, classes, and modules
- Structure comments to explain:
  - Purpose of the code
  - Input parameters and return values
  - Any important assumptions or limitations
  - Examples where helpful
- Use consistent comment formatting

## 3. Code Quality Best Practices
- Maintain consistent code formatting and style
- Write modular and reusable code
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Include input validation where appropriate
- Add logging statements for debugging purposes
- Implement proper error handling
- Include version compatibility information when relevant

## 4. Security Considerations
- Never expose sensitive information in comments or logs
- Include security-related warnings where applicable
- Document any security-related configurations
- Highlight potential security risks in the implementation
- Implement secure coding practices
- Follow security best practices for the language/framework

## 5. Performance Considerations
- Add comments about performance implications for complex operations
- Document any performance optimization techniques used
- Include resource usage considerations
- Optimize code where necessary
- Consider scalability implications

## 6. Code Maintenance
- Keep code documentation up-to-date
- Include deprecation notices when needed
- Document dependencies and requirements
- Add change logs for significant updates
- Follow versioning conventions
- Maintain backwards compatibility where possible
